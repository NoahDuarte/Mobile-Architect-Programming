# Mobile-Architect-Programming
CS-360 SNHU Mobile Architect &amp; Programming class.

  In this project, I opted to design an application to maintain an inventory of items. Within the application, I had to design a database that contained at least two tables, one to hold usernames and passwords, and the other to store the items held for the inventory. The application had to contain a login screen with a secondary screen so a user can create a username and password. I built a home screen (although not needed) where more functions could later be added. From the home screen, the user can access an activity to add new items to the inventory or tap another button that will direct them to browse a list of all inventory items. While browsing the can tap on an item to edit all fields of the item including the name, price, and quantity. Shared preferences were also used and the app requests permissions upon logging in to send sms notifications when an inventory item is low. 
  
  I wanted a simplistic design that was easy to learn and use. I built a home screen that could be used to expand the capabilities of the application. Currently, the only functions for the user are to add inventory items and to browse the current inventory in its entirety. There is a search bar at the top of the browse inventory screen that I did not have time to fully implement. There is a button in the action bar within the browsing activity to assist the user and add another step of simplicity. The user does not have to go back to the home screen to add an item, rather the user can add items while browsing. If the user adds an item from the home screen button the application will take the user back to the home screen after adding the item. However, if the user adds an item from the browse inventory screen the user will be taken back to the browse inventory screen. I tried to make the navigable as intuitive as possible. 
  
  I approached the design of this application with the user in mind. Navigating an application should be as user-friendly as possible. The code in the background is complex but built to be modularized and object-oriented to support a simplistic UI/UX design. The stressing of a simplistic design with the user in mind was done due to research of competitor applications that received negative ratings for being complicated and hard to understand. 
  
  Overall, I had a good time writing this program. While there is still a lot, I wish I had the time to do, designing the SQLite database was my Achilles heel. White spacing in the syntax when creating each column took more hours than I would like to admit troubleshooting. Android Studio did not catch the error of a single space that caused a column to not initialize. I looked over the Android developer website, stacks overflow, and many YouTube videos before I finally figured it out. 
  
  The one specific component that I was able to really shine on was my use of input validation. I learned how to use toast messages to communicate to the user when they did not properly fill out an input field. This input validation prevents a user to create an account without a password or username. Furthermore, the user can not add an inventory item without giving the item a name, setting a price, and entering a quantity. When editing the item, the user will still need to enter a valid input for each required field. I thought this was implemented quite nicely.
